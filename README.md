Printf

Printf is a C programming project that aims to recreate the functionality of the printf function from the C standard library. This implementation provides a customizable and extensible printf-like function for formatting and printing text in a variety of formats.

Features
Format Specifiers: Supports a wide range of format specifiers, including %d, %s, %c, %f, %x, and more. These format specifiers allow for printing various data types, such as integers, strings, characters, floats, and hexadecimal values.

Variable Argument List: CustomPrintf utilizes the va_list data type and the va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros to handle variable-length argument lists. This allows for printing a variable number of arguments based on the provided format string.

Formatting Options: Provides various formatting options, such as field width, precision, alignment, and padding. Users can control the output appearance by specifying these options in the format string.

Customization: The CustomPrintf function is designed to be easily extensible. Users can add their own custom format specifiers and corresponding handling functions to support additional data types or formatting requirements.
